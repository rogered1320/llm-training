Personnel may coordinate remote work schedules with their oCOO direct managers and People\u00b4s head, provided they meet the minimum office attendance requirements based on their role. |\n| **Attendance requirements for personnel who live less than an hour and a half from the nearest office**    -------------  *Up to 1:30 hs* *distance from the* nearest office | * **Engineers/QAs/Designers roles:**    + Seniors are expected to attend the office *at least 1 day per week*. This schedule allows flexibility while ensuring they are available for strategic meetings and mentoring.   + Semi-seniors are required to attend the office *at least 3 days per week*. This ensures they maintain a balance between office collaboration and remote work responsibilities.   + Juniors must attend the office *at least 4 days per week*. This benefits them from hands-on learning, closer supervision, and team collaboration. * **Operations & Administrative roles:**    + Their job requires full attendance (*5 days per week*). * **oCOO & oCEO roles:**    + Must attend the office *at least 2 days per week*. |\n| **Attendance requirements for personnel who live between an hour and a half to two hours and a half from the nearest office**    --------------------------------  *Between 1:30 hs up to 2:30 hs* *distance from the* nearest office | * **Engineers/QAs/Designers:**    + Seniors are expected to attend the office *at least 1 day per month*.   + Semi-seniors are required to attend the office *at least 2 days per month*.   + Juniors must attend the office *at least 1 day per week*. * **Operations & Administrative roles:**    + Their job requires full attendance (*5 days per week*). * **oCOO & oCEO Roles:**    + Must attend the office *at least 1 day per month*. |\n| **Attendance requirements for personnel who live more than two hours and a half from the nearest office**    --------------------------------------------------  *More than 2:30 hs*  *distance from the* nearest office | * Any position, seniority, and role, will be reviewed case by case.    + If you are in this situation, please send an email to your oCOO direct manager and People, so an office attendance schedule can be evaluated accordingly. |\n| **Attendance expectations** | * **Regular office hours**:    + Personnel is expected to be present during standard office hours *(9 hours)*, typically from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm (schedule that includes the daily 8 working hours and 1 hour for lunch), unless otherwise agreed in written upon with their client, oCOO direct manager, and People\u00b4s head. * **Punctuality**:    + Personnel should arrive on time and be ready to start their work at the beginning of their scheduled shift. |\n| **Exceptions** | * **Special circumstances:**    + BTS recognizes that unexpected events may impact attendance. In such cases, BTS may make exceptions at the discretion of the oCOO/oCEO.   + BTS understands that unforeseen circumstances may occasionally prevent personnel from meeting their attendance requirements.

The policy aims to prevent conflicts of interest, minimize any negative impact on performance and productivity, and mitigate risks of burnout and health issues.\n\n| **Additional work transparency: Policy** | |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Purpose** | * This policy aligns with our company values and aims to prevent conflicts of interest or any impact on performance, productivity, and personnel\u00b4s health that could arise from holding multiple additional jobs. * This policy is a guide to ensure that all employees and contractors are fully dedicated to their roles within the company during working hours and that all responsibilities are met without conflict. * This policy does not intend to restrict occasional additional employment, freelance work, or personal growth activities as long as they do not interfere with personnel's primary responsibilities at BTS. |\n| **Audience** | * This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and any individuals engaged in work on behalf of the company. |\n| **Policy** | |\n| **Topic** | **Details** |\n| **General guidelines** | * Everyone is expected to dedicate their full business time and effort to their roles at BTS. Holding a second full-time job without prior consent is strictly prohibited. * Occasional additional employment or freelance work permission will generally be granted.    + The key factors to consider include:      - Job performance,     - potential conflicts of interest related to the type of work, project, activity, or industry,     - and whether the extra work overlaps regular working hours. |\n| **Additional employment or freelance work** | * Additional employment or freelance work refers to any work that an individual undertakes outside of their primary job. This can include part-time positions with another employer (additional employment) or independent, self-directed work for various clients or projects (freelance work). |\n| **Reporting obligations** | * Employees or contractors who are already engaged in additional employment or freelance work and have received approval from the oCEO do not need to take any further action. * Employees or contractors currently holding additional employment or doing freelance work and had not reported yet must report this to their oCOO direct manager and People\u00b4s head, who will review each case individually and request the oCEO approval (if considered).  The deadline to report is - what happens last:    + Up to 15 calendar days after joining BTS.   + Up to 15 calendar days after the policy has been published. * Employees/contractors who wish to engage in additional employment or freelance work must notify their oCOO direct manager and People\u00b4s head, and obtain their approval, by submitting a request in writing (at least 15 calendar days before the intended additional employment or freelance work will begin), including details about the nature of the work, start date, end date, expected hours, and any potential impact on their role at BTS. |\n| **Devices consideration** | * Devices used for additional work must be separate from those provided by BTS. * Any other devices used for both (BTS activities and external or freelance work), must adhere to our security guidelines and best practices (just like BTS-provided devices). |\n| **Confidentiality** | * Employees/contractors must not disclose, share, or utilize any confidential or proprietary information of the company in their additional employment or freelance work. * Confidential information must not be shared or used in any capacity related to any other employment/work. |\n| **Following-up & tracking** | * The company will conduct regular performance evaluations for personnel whose requests have been approved. Any decline in performance may result in a reassessment of the granted permission. * Additionally, the company will carry out screening checks in each country where we have team members, including both employees and contractors, to identify anyone who may be violating this policy. |\n| **Waivers** | * Waivers from certain policy provisions may be sought following the BTS Waiver Process. |\n| **Enforcement** | * Personnel found to be inadvertently violating this policy will be reminded of our guidelines and expected to comply. * Personnel found to have violated this policy repeatedly or intentionally may be subject to disciplinary action, which may include verbal warnings, written warnings, or other appropriate measures as determined by management. * Non-disclosure of additional employment by the deadline may lead to legal action in accordance with local laws. |\n| **Review of Policy** | * To ensure our policies remain relevant and effective, the People area will periodically review this policy. * Any updates or changes to the policy will be communicated to all employees promptly. |\n\n| **Version History** | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Version | Modified Date | Approved Date | Approved By: | Reason/Comments |\n| 1.0.0 |  |  | oCOO | Documentation creation |\n\n:judge:1f9d1-200d-2696-fe0f\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\u2696\ufe0f#FFFAE6\n\n*This policy is not intended to conflict with any local laws or regulations, including those related to employment rights or anti-discrimination laws.

    "title": "Main Goals for 2024 - By: Rosalba Reynoso",
    "content": "On Feb. 28, 2024, Rosalba posted the main goals for 2024.\n\n1. **Focus on our people.** We have observed a concerning trend of diminished interactions between our management and employees in 2022 and even more so in 2023.\u00a0 There were fewer 1on1s, lack of clarity in the assessment and career paths processes, etc.). Rosalba has tasked Lorenzo in Mexico, with the support of Christian del Rio and Ismael Perez, Vram in Argentina, Cesar in Spain, and Magdalena in Uruguay, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador to make sure that 2024 brings significant improvement in our support to you. They will report progress to her regularly. Employees\u2019 feedback remains critical to the success of our company.\n2. **Let go of clients** **whose culture is too far from ours**. In the past, we have been too lenient with some clients who have been proven excessively difficult, or whose culture and values diverged significantly from our own.\u00a0 We need to prepare to let these clients go, while safeguarding our financial interests.\n3. **Let go of non-performing employees**. The COVID years have witnessed an unprecedented surge in activity across software companies, including Blue Trail. To face demand, we all had to hire individuals who would not have been hired under normal conditions. As employment landscape has shifted dramatically in 2022 and 2023, our clients are demanding nothing but outstanding performance. We had to let some employees go in 2023 and early 2024, as their level of performance was no longer aligned with the new market requirements. Fortunately, this process is nearing its conclusion, and we have started to increase our workforce again.\n4. **Empower our internal teams.** We firmly believe that mentoring and coaching are critical to support our developers\u2019 growth. To this end, we created internal groups dedicated to mentoring and leveraging the insights gained from working with our clients. While our QA group is the most advanced one, other groups are also progressing, including the PM/TL one, which is a critical one to reinforce our PM and TL capabilities. We are committed to further strengthening these groups through enhanced structuring and reinforcement of our mentoring initiatives.\n5. **Embrace technology changes.** Generative AI is bringing massive disruption to the way applications will be developed in the near future. Our oCTO group is crafting training plans aimed at providing our developers with the necessary knowledge and skills to remain skilled and competitive. 2024 is a pivotal year and the perfect time to get trained, as we anticipate a surge in AI-powered application development to emerge late 2024 and 2025.\n6. **Better structure our sales offer to expand sales more rapidly**. We have cultivated over the years a strong expertise in several areas, notably in QA automation. We want us to leverage this expertise by creating additional offers for our clients, and have these offers promoted both in the USA and Europe.\n7. **Increase our company headcount**. We had to reduce our headcount in 2023 to better prepare ourselves to face dramatic changes in customer demand and in technology. We are ready to resume hiring again, with the objective of surpassing the 200-employee mark during the first part of 2025.\n8. **Summits**. Summits have been part of our company history since its inception, serving as a privileged way to shape our culture. Experience has taught us that some adjustments were necessary before, during, and after the summits. We are working on a series of improvements that will be communicated to you as soon as available.",

    "content": "About us:\n---------\n\nBlue Trail Software is a San Francisco-based software development company, founded in 2013, with production centers in Argentina, Bolivia, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Spain.\n\nThe company specializes in creating sophisticated WEB solutions, mobile applications, IoT (Internet of Things) platforms, AI-powered solutions, and back-end engines.\n\nOur core objective is to become an agile and resilient organization centered on the empowerment of our stakeholders (employees, clients, suppliers, and the local environment).\n\nOur business model is predicated on the following beliefs:\n\n* **We believe in our people**; success starts with a well-trained, disciplined, and passionate workforce. We do not have a low attrition rate by accident,\n* **We believe in empowering people**; we pledge to our employees to create the conditions that will compel them to transform themselves. Our one desire is to be the best company we can be,\n* **We believe in creativity and execution, not in competition;** while we truly respect the success and vision of the industry leaders, we do not measure our success by comparing ourselves to any other software development company. Our success comes from our ability to execute our vision, one step at a time, while constantly making sure that our direction remains aligned with our vision,\n* **We believe in patience;** we are here for the long run, building what we believe a corporation of the 21st century should look like; the company is owned by its management team, and does not depend upon any bank, investment fund, or VC,\n* **We believe in diversity**; each new employee, new client, and new supplier makes us vastly more connected, more diverse, and more powerful,\n* **We believe in giving back to our communities**; our local communities matter to us. Making a difference in the life of our communities is core to our mission.\n\nOur mission statement reads:\n----------------------------\n\n> *Our mission is to excel in the global marketplace while benefiting our stakeholders (employees, vendors, clients, etc.) and the society, by simultaneously optimizing financial performance, ethical practice, social contribution, and environmental impact.*\n\nOverview of Blue Trail\u2019s structure and major functions:\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs per our constitution, our company is allowed a maximum of 3 levels of management depth to preserve its agility. The configuration of these management levels may be altered with approval from the level-1 leadership team but must always remain limited to three levels.\n\nNo employee will be more than 2 management levels away from the CEO\u2019s level.\n\nUntil now, our organizational structure has comprised two levels of depth: the office of the CEO, overseen by Rosalba, and the countries. In recent years, we have witnessed the emergence of several organized groups dedicated to capitalizing on our collective experience in various areas. Among these, the QA group and the mentoring group are the most advanced, with other groups becoming increasingly organized and productive. This development may prompt a shift in focus for the second level of management from a country-based structure to a group-based structure or at least a mix between the two.\n\nThe current structure leadership structure has 3 main components:\n\n* Office of the CEO, focused on the corporate vision and strategy,\n* Office of the COO, focused on operations,\n* Office of the CTO, in charge of defining our technical priorities.",

The employee/consultant/contractor must have been with the company for at least 3 years. 2. Have an impeccable track record. It means that both the BTS management team(s) and the client(s) must have been entirely satisfied from the first day of employment. 3. There must be an open position in the destination country corresponding to the profile of the petitioner. |\n| **Process** | 1. Get in contact with your level 2 manager to request your relocation. 2. The level 2 management team of the current petitioner\u00b4s country will assess the situation with People Area and if they approve, they will proceed with the request to the Lvl-2 management team of the destination country.   The Lvl-2 management team of the petitioner and/or destination country can reject the petition.   3. a. If everything is approved in step 2, the level 2 management team of the current petitioner\u00b4s country will proceed with the request to the Lvl-1 management team.   The Lvl-1 management team can reject the petition.   3. b. If any of the parties involved in step 2 rejects the petition, the level 2 management team of the current petitioner\u00b4s country will explain the reasons to the petitioner. 4. If everything is finally approved by Lvl-1, the level 2 management team of the current petitioner\u00b4s country will begin the relocation process with People area.   In case the petition is approved, the cost of applying for the first working visa (if needed) is covered by BTS.  Any other costs related (like getting visas for family members, travel expenses, visa renewals, etc.), is the employee/consultant/contractor responsibility. |\n| **Waivers** | * Waivers from certain policy provisions may be sought following the BTS Waiver Process. |\n| **Enforcement** | * Personnel found to be inadvertently violating this policy will be reminded of our guidelines and expected to comply. * Personnel found to have violated this policy repeated or intentionally may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, and related civil or criminal penalties. * Any vendor, consultant, or contractor found to have violated this policy repeated or intentional may be subject to sanctions up to and including removal of access rights, termination of contract(s), and related civil or criminal penalties. |\n| **Review of Policy** | * To ensure our policies remain relevant and effective, the People area will periodically review this policy. * Any updates or changes to the policy will be communicated to all employees promptly. |\n\n| **Version History** | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Version | Modified Date | Approved Date | Approved By: | Reason/Comments |\n| 1.0.1 |  |  | oCOO | Document review and update to aligned with BTS policy documentation standards. |\n\n:judge:1f9d1-200d-2696-fe0f\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\u2696\ufe0f#FFFAE6\n\n*This policy aims to create an efficient country relocation process and is not intended to conflict with any local laws or regulations, including those related to employment rights or anti-discrimination laws. If any part of this policy appears to be in conflict, the relevant local laws shall take precedence.*",

You don\u00b4t have to wait for an open vacancy to refer someone you believe could be a great addition to the team! * Only two groups of people cannot be referred to:    + Candidates who were previously laid off due to company rules and regulations violations.   + Candidates currently employed by one of our clients, either directly or through an agency. |\n| **Types of referrals** | We divided referrals into 2 groups:   * **Direct referrals**: An individual you know through a personal relationship, such as friends or former colleagues. * **Indirect referrals**: An individual you are acquainted with through social media, including those who have reached out to you or whom you have contacted about their interest in joining BTS. |\n| **The key skills that we expect every referred candidate to have** | The following is a list of essential qualities for all openings to ensure strong values, culture, and functional fit within our company.   * **Adaptability, initiative, and teamwork** skills. * **Integrity** and **commitment.** * **Proficiency in English**, (good communication skills in English).   Of course, we understand that it may not be feasible to know the individual well in the case of an indirect referral. |\n| **A brief guide about the referral process** | * **1st Step:**  **Send an email to our Talent Referral Team**    To: Include all members: [gracielap@bluetrailsoft.com](mailto:gracielap@bluetrailsoft.com), [lorenzop@bluetrailsoft.com](mailto:lorenzop@bluetrailsoft.com), [ismaelp@bluetrailsoft.com](mailto:ismaelp@bluetrailsoft.com), [leandrom@bluetrailsoft.com](mailto:leandrom@bluetrailsoft.com)  Cc: our CEO: [rosalba@bluetrailsoft.com](mailto:rosalba@bluetrailsoft.com)  Subject: Talent Referral Program: [Name of the candidate]  Make sure to add in the e-mail at least the following information:    + General introduction about your referral:      - Include:        * For Direct Referrals: Tell us how you met this person, what is your current relationship, and why you believe it could be a good fit for BTS.       * For Indirect Referrals: Tell us how you met this person, and why you believe it could be a good fit for BTS.       * For all Referrals: always feel free to add any other information you consider that can be important for us to know beforehand.     - Your referral contact information:        * Complete Name       * Email Address       * Phone number     - Your referral\u00b4s resume should be attached        * You can also add their LinkedIn profile * **2nd Step:**  **The Talent Referral Team will review the candidate\u00b4s experience and your considerations, and schedule a first meeting to meet the person** (if applies)    + You will be posted about it! * **3rd Step:**  **If we happen to be a match and we have a current open position, after step 2, the regular recruitment process will be followed:**    + The recruitment process typically includes (but may vary), an Online Assessment, a Technical Interview, a Client Interview, and the final Cultural Interview by our CEO.   + You will be informed of each step of the process of your referral (while respecting any necessary confidentiality). |\n| **Other guidelines** | * Personnel can refer candidates as many times as they wish. It\u00b4s an unlimited program! * If multiple people refer the same candidate, the person who first submitted the candidate to the Talent Referral Group will be credited as the person who had referred the candidate for 6 months.    + 6 months after the referral date, the candidate will no longer be considered a referred person. This means the following:      - Any other BTS member can refer the same candidate again, and the referral will be credited to the new BTS member who submits the candidate.     - The candidate can apply to one of our job vacancies directly and will not be considered a referral.     - If the candidate is contacted by the Talent Referral Group, oCEO/Lvl1, oCOO/Lvl2, oCTO, and/or the TA Team, the candidate will be reactivated as a referral, and the credit will be given to the person or divided between the people who referred the candidate to the company. |\n| **Bonus\\*** | * As a reward for boosting our company growth, personnel might receive a bonus if the referral person joins BTS.    + Bonus applies for all personnel except those of the following groups: oCEO/Lvl1, oCOO/Lvl2, oCTO, and/or TA Team.   + Bonus applies for all open vacancies, except for OPS/Administrative positions.   + Bonus applies for all referral candidates, except for former contributors.   + Bonus will be paid as follows:      - 20% of the bonus will be paid the month after the referral candidate joins BTS.     - The 80% missing, after the referral candidate passes their Trial Period (3 months). * You can find the Bonuses\u00b4 values in this same space after the program policy ends. The ones in green are the current ones:    + The bonus values might change. Stay tuned!   + The bonus value applied for the referral candidate will be the one that was \u201ccurrent\u201d at the referral date (e-mail). |\n| **Waivers** | * Waivers from certain policy provisions may be sought following the BTS Waiver Process. |\n| **Enforcement** | * Personnel found to be inadvertently violating this policy will be reminded of our guidelines and expected to comply. * Personnel found to have violated this policy repeatedly or intentionally may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, and related civil or criminal penalties. * Any vendor, consultant, or contractor found to have violated this policy repeated or intentional may be subject to sanctions up to and including removal of access rights, termination of contract(s), and related civil or criminal penalties. |\n| **Review of Policy** | * To ensure our policies remain relevant and effective, the People area will periodically review this policy. * Any updates or changes to the policy will be communicated to all employees promptly. |\n\n:face\\_with\\_monocle:1f9d0\ud83e\uddd0#E3FCEF\n\n**Wondering which are the current open vacancies?**\n\nYou will find in the following link, all the information we have about BTS open positions, including the JDs: \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Staffing - Open Positions\n\n| **CURRENT BONUS VALUES**   * Bonus values might change. * The bonus value applied will be according to the date you refer the candidate. * Please consider that the bonus amount must be withheld from the corresponding taxes for each entity. | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Country** | **Bonus Direct Referrals** \\*(consider that this amount must be withheld from the corresponding taxes for each entity) | **Bonus In-direct Referrals** \\*(consider that this amount must be withheld from the corresponding taxes for each entity) | **Date & Reference if applies** |\n| USA | * Semi-seniors/Senior: 1000 USD gross | * Semi-senior/Senior: 500 USD gross | From June 15th, 2022 |\n| All countries\\* (except USA) | * Software Engineer/Junior: 300 USD gross * Semi-seniors/Senior: 500 USD gross | * Software Engineer/Junior: 150 USD gross * Semi-seniors/Senior: 250 USD gross | From January 25th, 2021  \\*Reference: New Talent Referral Program Policy published in Confluence and BTS Referral personnel chat. |\n\n| **Version History** | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Version | Modified Date | Approved Date | Approved By: | Reason/Comments |\n| 1.0.3 | October 2024 | October 2024 | CEO | Document reviewed due to updates in our internal procedures |\n| 1.0.2 | October 2021 | October 2021 | CEO | Document alignment with BTS policies format |\n| 1.0.1 | May, 2nd, 2021 | May, 2nd, 2021 | CEO | Update on types of referrals (Direct/Indirect) |\n| 1.0.0 | Year X | Year X | Level1 | Documentation creation |\n\n:judge:1f9d1-200d-2696-fe0f\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\u2696\ufe0f#FFFAE6\n\n*This policy is not intended to conflict with any local laws or regulations, including those related to employment rights or anti-discrimination laws.
