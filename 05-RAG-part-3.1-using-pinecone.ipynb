Rosalba has tasked Lorenzo in Mexico, with the support of Christian del Rio and Ismael Perez, Vram in Argentina, Cesar in Spain, and Magdalena in Uruguay, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador to make sure that 2024 brings significant improvement in our support to you. They will report progress to her regularly. Employees’ feedback remains critical to the success of our company.\\n2. **Let go of clients** **whose culture is too far from ours**. In the past, we have been too lenient with some clients who have been proven excessively difficult, or whose culture and values diverged significantly from our own.\\xa0 We need to prepare to let these clients go, while safeguarding our financial interests.\\n3. **Let go of non-performing employees**. The COVID years have witnessed an unprecedented surge in activity across software companies, including Blue Trail. To face demand, we all had to hire individuals who would not have been hired under normal conditions. As employment landscape has shifted dramatically in 2022 and 2023, our clients are demanding nothing but outstanding performance. We had to let some employees go in 2023 and early 2024, as their level of performance was no longer aligned with the new market requirements. Fortunately, this process is nearing its conclusion, and we have started to increase our workforce again.\\n4. **Empower our internal teams.** We firmly believe that mentoring and coaching are critical to support our developers’ growth. To this end, we created internal groups dedicated to mentoring and leveraging the insights gained from working with our clients. While our QA group is the most advanced one, other groups are also progressing, including the PM/TL one, which is a critical one to reinforce our PM and TL capabilities. We are committed to further strengthening these groups through enhanced structuring and reinforcement of our mentoring initiatives.'),\n",

Our oCTO group is crafting training plans aimed at providing our developers with the necessary knowledge and skills to remain skilled and competitive. 2024 is a pivotal year and the perfect time to get trained, as we anticipate a surge in AI-powered application development to emerge late 2024 and 2025.\\n6. **Better structure our sales offer to expand sales more rapidly**. We have cultivated over the years a strong expertise in several areas, notably in QA automation. We want us to leverage this expertise by creating additional offers for our clients, and have these offers promoted both in the USA and Europe.\\n7. **Increase our company headcount**. We had to reduce our headcount in 2023 to better prepare ourselves to face dramatic changes in customer demand and in technology. We are ready to resume hiring again, with the objective of surpassing the 200-employee mark during the first part of 2025.\\n8. **Summits**. Summits have been part of our company history since its inception, serving as a privileged way to shape our culture. Experience has taught us that some adjustments were necessary before, during, and after the summits.
